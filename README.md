# Improper Error Handling in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: inadequate error handling in route handlers. The `bug.js` file shows a route that fails to handle database errors gracefully.  The solution, `bugSolution.js`, provides improved error handling and informative responses.

## Problem

The original code lacks comprehensive error handling for database interactions. If a database error occurs, it sends a generic 'Internal Server Error' message without providing any details about the root cause.  This makes debugging and user experience poor.

## Solution

The solution implements robust error handling, logging errors for debugging, and sending more informative responses to the client (e.g., 404 Not Found if the user is not found, or a 500 Internal Server Error with a more descriptive message).
